This is a short presentation/report done during my reading project in winter 2022 at IISER Pune, under guidance of Dr. Ashish Arora.

The report has detailed derivation of Chandrasekhar mass limit, which the maximum mass that a stable White Dwarf can have and its value is around 1.4 solar mass. Above Chandrasekhar limit, the electron degeneracy pressure in the star's core is insufficient to balance the star's own gravitational self-attraction. The derivation uses various concepts from different disciplines of Physics - Quantum Mechanics, Special Relativity, Statistical Mechanics.
